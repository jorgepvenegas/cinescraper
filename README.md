# cinescraper

### Basic NodeJS scraper with no specific purpose. Just for fun.

* Install all the dependencies using `npm install`
* Run `node index.js`
* Go to `http://localhost:8181/theatres`
* Check your project directory and you'll find a new JSON file with the data gathered from http://www.cinemark.cl/theatres/.
